# Past Projects

## [MM Bus Ticket]
MM Bus Ticket is the market leader in Burma in providing a digital platform for long-distance coach buses to sell and manage seat inventory. 

I had the privilege of working with real data (over 4.4m transactions in 2018 alone) and understanding how data systems cope with business constraints in the real world. I undertook major data cleaning and transformation to deliver new insights. Machine learning models were also used to predict ticket sales for different customer segments.


## [Ames housing dataset: Predicting sales prices](https://github.com/chenyze/project-2)

Using the Ames Housing Dataset that is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dsi-us-6-project-2-regression-challenge), I attempted to
* identify the features that best predict housing sale prices
* build a regression model with as low an R<sup>2</sup> score as possible.


## [Subreddit classification](https://github.com/chenyze/project-3)

I built a supervised machine learning model to classify unseen reddit posts into either r/wine or r/whisky. The data was scraped using Reddit's API together with BeautifulSoup, and Regex was used extensively to remove emoji, links and accented letters. SpaCy was used for lemmatizing and tokenizing, and I ran multiple models comparingCountVectorizer vs TF-IDF, as well as Logistic Regression vs Multinomial Naive Bayes vs Random Forest Classifier.
